<h2>What is OWASP ZSC ?</h2>
<br /><a href="http://z3r0d4y.com/">OWASP ZeroDay Cyber Research</a> Shellcoder [Generator] is an open source software in python language which lets you generate customized  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode">shellcodes</a> for listed operation systems. This software can be run on Linux/OSX under python 2.7.x.

<br /><h2>Usage of shellcodes</h2>
<br /><b>Shellcodesare small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing antiviruses, obfuscated codes and etc.
<br /><h2>Why use OWASP ZSC ?</h2>
<br />According to other shellcode generators same as metasploit tools and etc, OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.<br />
OWASP ZSC encoderes are able to generate shellcodes with <strong>random encodes</strong> and that's lets you to get <strong>thousands new dynamic shellcodes</strong> with same job in just a second,that means you will not get a same code if you use random encodes with same commands, And that make OWASP ZSC one of the bests! otherwise it's gonna generate shellcodes for many operation systems in next versions.
